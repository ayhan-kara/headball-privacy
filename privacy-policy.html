  <h1>Head Ball VR Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    This privacy policy applies to the Head Ball VR application, developed by Dark VR (hereafter referred to as “Developer”). By using Head Ball VR, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Required Information:</strong> User ID and basic matchmaking data are collected during multiplayer sessions to enable online gameplay. These identifiers are not linked to personal information beyond the in-app account name.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Analytical Data:</strong> Anonymous usage statistics (such as match duration, level progression, and device performance) may be collected to improve gameplay balance and optimize performance. No personally identifiable information is included.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Audio & Motion Data:</strong> Voice chat audio and hand‐tracking motion data are processed locally on your device to enable real-time communication and controls. This data is not stored on servers nor shared with third parties.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Data needed for real-time multiplayer functionality (matchmaking, player positioning, voice chat) is transmitted in encrypted form to our servers solely for the duration of your gameplay session.
    </li>
    <li>
      Analytical data is aggregated and anonymized. We use it to identify bug patterns, understand player behavior trends, and enhance future updates. Individual players remain anonymous.
    </li>
    <li>
      We do not use collected data for advertising or user profiling. Any third‐party SDKs (e.g., analytics libraries) operate in compliance with their own privacy terms and only receive anonymous, non‐personal telemetry.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage & Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All data processed for voice chat and motion tracking remains on your device and is discarded when you exit the app. No voice recordings or motion logs are retained by our servers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Matchmaking identifiers and in‐game statistics are stored in encrypted databases for up to 30 days to allow for minimal moderation and troubleshooting. After 30 days, this data is permanently deleted.
    </li>
    <li>
      We employ industry‐standard encryption protocols (HTTPS, TLS) when transmitting data between your device and our servers to protect against interception or unauthorized access.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third‐Party Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. The only entities with access to any game‐related data are our authorized analytics partners, and they only receive anonymized usage metrics. We do not share real‐time voice or motion data with any external organization.
  </p>

  <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You have the right to request access to any data we hold about you, or to request deletion of your personal data. To do so, please contact us at <a href="mailto:ayhankara_01@hotmail.com">ayhankara_01@hotmail.com</a>. We will respond to your request within 30 days.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Head Ball VR is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately so we can delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. When we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the bottom of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.
